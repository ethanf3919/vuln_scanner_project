Step 1: Project Setup

Environment Setup:
Set up a virtual environment for your project using tools like virtualenv or venv.
Install necessary dependencies using pip.
Version Control:
Initialize a Git repository for your project.
Commit the initial project structure.

Step 2: Web Crawling

Choose a Library:
Decide whether to use BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for web crawling.
Basic Web Crawling:
Write code to fetch the HTML content of a webpage.
Explore the structure of the HTML and understand how to extract links.
Crawling Multiple Pages:
Extend your code to crawl multiple pages by following links.

Step 3: HTTP Requests

Use the Requests Library:
Implement code to send various types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) to the discovered endpoints.
Handle Responses:
Process and handle the responses from the server.

Step 4: Vulnerability Scanning

Research Vulnerability Scanners:
Explore and choose suitable tools or libraries for each type of vulnerability you want to check.
Integration:
Integrate the chosen vulnerability scanners into your project.
Implement checks for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.

Step 5: Reporting

Define Report Structure:
Decide on the structure and format of your vulnerability reports.
Generate Reports:
Implement code to generate reports based on the identified vulnerabilities.

Step 6: Configurability

User Input:
Allow users to input the target website and configure scanning options.
Sensitivity Settings:
Implement sensitivity settings for the scanner.

Step 7: User Interface (Optional)

Choose a Framework:
If you opt for a UI, choose a web framework like Flask or Django.
Build UI Components:
Create pages for input, scanning progress, and report display.

Step 8: Logging and Alerts

Implement Logging:
Set up logging to record the scanning process and results.
Alerts (Optional):
If you're adding email alerts, implement SMTP functionality.

Step 9: Testing

Unit Testing:
Write unit tests for critical functions.
Manual Testing:
Manually test the scanner on different web applications to ensure accuracy.

Step 10: Documentation

Write Documentation:
Document how to use your tool, its features, and any dependencies.
Code Comments:
Add comments to your code for clarity.

Step 11: Publish and Share

GitHub Repository:
Push your code to a GitHub repository.
Write a README file explaining the project, how to set it up, and use it.
Portfolio/Resume:
Include the link to your project on your portfolio or resume.
